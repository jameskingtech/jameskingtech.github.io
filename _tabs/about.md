A page all about me, wow, where to start. 

If you want to short of it, I'm a british guy, who likes tech, mechanical stuff and space amazes me. Going back to where it all began though, I vividly remember playing games when I was about 5 like Crash Bandicoot, what a game! Around the same time I was taking all sorts of things apart and putting them back together again while being told off for doing it, all just because I was curious how the thing worked.

That curiosity for understanding how things around me functioned stuck with me through my years growing up and even now into adulthood. It's great, but also really annoying sometimes, like when you want to replace a door lock, nice and simple for any normal person, however when I get involved, it's 2 or 3 days of intense research. Understanding different mechanisms, keeps, bolts, thumb vs key, understanding some of the deeper thinking that goes into regs around why certain ones fit certain places. It's a rabit hole of info, that most people just don't care about, for some reason, I do, and get sucked in, every single time. Paint on the walls, Washing Machines, Printers, Car Washing supplies, honestly the list goes on.

I've never truly known what I wanted to do growing up, but that curiosity for understanding the world around me, and my passion for tech has landed me in Software Engineering. It's great, being able to shape and improve some of the core software millions of people interact with in every day life.
