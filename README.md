# James King Tech Web Repo

## Description

Here you'll find the source code for my personal site, https://www.jamesking.tech. On the site you'll find information surrounding what I've been up too surrounding the world of tech. From personal projects in the Homelab, all the way to Enterprise scale solutions leveraging AWS and other industry leading platforms and products. It won't all just be software though, I like to tinker with hardware from time to time, explore IoT and Home Automation stuff, so expect to see a bit of it all hopefully as time goes on!

It's all hosted using GitHub pages, and beautifully styled with the awesome open source jekyll theme [Chirpy](chirpy), if you want to create something similar, check them out!
